  "difficulty": "hard",
  "time_minutes": 20,
  "tools": [
    "Digital multimeter (\u22654\u00bd digit, e.g., Fluke 87V)",
    "5.000 V precision voltage reference (e.g., LM4040, \u00b10.1%)",
    "Thermally stable environment (\u00b10.5\u00b0C)",
    "Shielded test leads"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Allow DMM and voltage reference to warm up for 30 minutes in a \u00b10.5\u00b0C room.",
    "Set DMM to DC voltage mode with 0.1 mV resolution.",
    "Connect reference to DMM using shielded cables; minimize lead loop area.",
    "Wait 10 seconds for reading to stabilize.",
    "If DMM reads \u00b10.001 V from 5.000 V, note the offset.",
    "If internal adjustment is possible, calibrate zero point and span using trimpots or service menu according to manufacturer specs.",
    "Recheck: reading should now be within \u00b10.0005 V of 5.000 V (\u00b10.01%)."
